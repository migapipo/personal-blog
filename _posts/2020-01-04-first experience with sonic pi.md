# What is Sonic Pi

Sonic Pi is a code-based music creation and performance tool.

One of the most exciting aspects of Sonic Pi is that it enables you to write and modify code live to make music, just like you might perform live with a guitar. This means that given some practice you can take Sonic Pi on stage and gig with it.


# First impression of Sonic Pi
Sonic Pi seems really cool to me because I played guitar myself. I think I can use Sonic Pi as a guitar to play some great songs. 


# Example Code
