# PHP
PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor


If you have purchased paid hosting, you may be able to upload your PHP files. 99% hosting companies allow to run PHP on the server. What if we want to test everything locally in our computer? 

If we want to develop quickly and easily on our local machine.  
So what we can do is essencially turn our computer into a web server 

But it is highly unrecommended you allow people to access this web sever, because there will be some security issues. 

what I am showing you is you open up a port on your computer, if you open port 80 on your computer, which is going to allow people to access everything that yo put into your *htdocs* folder.
