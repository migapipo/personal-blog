## Communication
Digging through raw data doesn’t help anyone if they lack the communication skills to tell the rest of the team about my findings in a way that’s easy to understand. As a data analysts, I have excellent communications skills across a variety of mediums, including written, verbal and specialty visualization software.

Sometimes I may be required to report their conclusions to a team in a group setting, so public speaking and presentation are valuable skills that I gained from my work. 
Thanks to top-notch communication skills, I can help our company’s leaders make informed decisions about what to do next.

## Problem solving
Mining for and organizing data doesn’t happen with just the push of a button. Technology doesn’t always run perfectly. 
When hiccups arise in an algorithm, a database or lines of code, as a data analyst, I must be able to find and troubleshoot the problem so I can continue to efficiently capture the data I need.

Data analysts also put their problem-solving skills to work when collaborating with their team on big-picture issues. 
They must work together with others in their company to decide which problems to target and how to solve them via data analysis.

## Research
You might think data analysts have all the information they need at their fingertips. The truth is that data analysts should be prepared to do some digging if they want to make the most out of the data they collect.

Data analysts use research to stay on top of industry trends so they can interpret the most meaningful insights from their data. Research also comes in handy when they’re presenting their findings to their colleagues and defending their position on what move the company should make next.

## Attention to detail
In many ways, a data analyst’s job is similar to searching for a needle in a haystack. Data analysts must be able to notice the small clues that point toward a larger message that’s hiding in a group of data. 
“The actual task of reporting and gathering data can be tedious and hard to read, so drawing meaningful conclusions from that data is a skill that can always be improved,” Petermeyer says.

Attention to detail also comes in handy when I build the processes that efficiently capture and sort data. 
A small error in a single line of code can throw the entire workflow away. 
I would always be on the lookout for tiny mistakes that can lead to larger problems in the system.

## Teamwork
Data analysts collaborate with people in a variety of positions to get the job done. 
They work with data scientists to determine what types of questions can be answered through data analysis. 
They also collaborate with web developers to ensure that their company’s website is designed to efficiently capture the data they need.

On a big-picture scale, data analysts collaborate with company leaders to determine how the latest data insights can guide the company in moving forward toward its objectives.
