# React Learning Process Track
## Section 1: Intro 
Started to learning React today. 

### What is React? -  "A JavaScript Library for building User Interface" 

Components for building User Interface (Header, Sidebar, Headline, Article Content). 

You can think components like Building Blocks. (Maybe you can see it as a Lego block, and you are building a car using several small lego blocks.) 

### Pros: 
- Maintainable Teamwork
- Manageable Code
- Reusable Code
- Custom HTML elements

Code writing Tool: CodePen

HTML, CSS, Javascript are the fundamental knowledge you need to know when you learn React. 


## Section 2: Refreshing Next Generation of JS

var -> let & const

let -> variable values
const -> constant values
