<p class="message">
  Hey there! This page is my self introduction. Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn :) 
</p>


Master of IT graduate with a penchant for learning, in-depth knowledge of software development and database system, hands-on experience in **Python** and **Java** programming. I am looking for new opportunities in the IT field where I can apply and develop both my soft skills and technical skills.

Telecommunication engineering and IT background equip me with both telecommunication and software knowledge as well as fast learning ability. I worked for OMC International as a Software Engineer Intern during my Master study. My major responsibilities include developing new software features and testing products algorithms using **C#**, **HTML**, **JavaScript**, and **CSS** in the **ASP.NET** framework. I also studied and applied Java during my Masterâ€™s degree. I was exposed to different software development projects which enhanced my programming and software development skills. I worked in an agile team environment where I gained exposure and understanding of business management systems and Web applications.

I demonstrated the ability to exercise initiative and sound judgment with proven problem-solving skills when there are some issues happened. I am proficient in Microsoft Office suite and various project management tools (e.g. **Jira, Confluence, Slack**).

I love programming and I think Java and Python are my favorite languages. I have a keen interest in Data Engineering, Front End Development (I am learning *React* myself) and Machine Learning. I have previously interned with OMC International as a software Engineer Intern and Data Analyst/Research Intern.

Don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or you could just maybe drop me a message (via LinkedIn or my email) and say hi!
